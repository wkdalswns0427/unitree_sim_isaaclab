Patch Log: DDS Observation Init Retry Fix
Date: 2026-02-12

Context
- During startup, observation modules tried to acquire DDS objects before dds_create.py had registered them.
- They cached None with a one-time initialized flag, so DDS publishing from observations never recovered.
- Symptom in logs: "object 'g129' not found" / "object 'dex1' not found" early, then no recovery.

What was changed
1) Replaced one-shot init behavior with retry-on-miss behavior in observation DDS getters.
2) Added throttled retry (1.0s interval) to avoid tight-loop overhead.
3) Switched lookup to dds_manager.objects.get(...) to avoid noisy "object not found" logs from get_object().
4) Kept cleanup registration, but only register once after successful acquisition.

Files modified
- tasks/common_observations/g1_29dof_state.py
- tasks/common_observations/gripper_state.py
- tasks/common_observations/inspire_state.py
- tasks/common_observations/dex3_state.py

Behavior before
- _get_*_dds_instance() set _dds_initialized=True even when object was missing.
- Later calls skipped reacquisition and remained None.

Behavior after
- If DDS object is missing, getter returns None and schedules next retry.
- Once dds_create.py registers DDS objects, getter acquires successfully and continues normal writes.

Validation done
- Python syntax compile check passed:
  python -m py_compile
    tasks/common_observations/g1_29dof_state.py
    tasks/common_observations/gripper_state.py
    tasks/common_observations/inspire_state.py
    tasks/common_observations/dex3_state.py

How to verify at runtime
1) Run sim_main.py normally.
2) Ensure early "object not found" spam is gone or minimized.
3) After DDS registration, expect one-time messages like:
   - [g1_state] G1 robot DDS communication instance obtained
   - [gripper_state] DDS communication instance obtained
4) Confirm DDS state streams are active from your downstream subscriber.

Notes
- This patch addresses DDS object acquisition race only.
- The separate rerun_visualizer indentation issue is not modified in this patch.
